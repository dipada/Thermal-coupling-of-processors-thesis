# Thermal-coupling-of-processors-thesis
Thesis on Thermal coupling of multicore CPUs.
In multicore architectures, CPUs belong to the same silicon die. This implies that if one CPU overheats (due to the running
workload), the neighboring CPUs also heats up (due to thermal conductance) preventing them to run at full speed.
This phenomenon is investigated using rt-app and ftrace mainly.
